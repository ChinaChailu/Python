When I create WPF using MVVM pattern, I need define multi ViewModel/Model class inherited from INPC(INotifyPropertyChanged).
I need write multi times for  private filed and call OnPropertyChanged method. 

#How to use
You can define your C# perperties on your VM/M class, and then drag your code file to this utility(or you can input your file path).
This tool can add private field and OnPropertyChanged to every property.
