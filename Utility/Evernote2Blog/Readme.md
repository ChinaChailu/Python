#Purpose

I create Evernote2Blog utility to convert my evernote's notes to blog of metaweblog type.
This utility use evernote's dev token and noteStore url (these information you can get from evernote dev site. https://www.evernote.com/api/DeveloperToken.action) to access your evernote account, and get your notebooks' notes. After got that data, use metaweblog api to publish new blog  according your blog configuration.

Before use this utility, you need get evernote-sdk-python3 source code from https://github.com/evernote/evernote-sdk-python3 firtst. 

#Configuration
This utility use three config files.

######"config" 
config your auth token, notestoreUrl, username, password, and so on. May be like this:  
    	"authToken":"your evernote dev auth token",  
    	"noteStoreUrl":"your evernote store",  
    	"blogServer":"http://your blog api url",  
    	"blogName":"your blog name",
