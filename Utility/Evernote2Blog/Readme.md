#Purpose

I create Evernote2Blog utility to convert my evernote's notes to blog of metaweblog type.
This utility use evernote's dev token and noteStore url (these information you can get from evernote dev site.) to access your evernote account, and get your notebooks' notes. After got that data, use metaweblog api to publish new blog  according your blog configuration.


#Configuration
This utility use two config files.

"config" config your auth token, notestoreUrl, username, password, and so on. May be like this:  
    *"authToken":"your evernote dev auth token",  
    *"noteStoreUrl":"your evernote store",  
    *"blogServer":"http://your blog api url",  
    *"blogName":"your blog name",  
    *"blogUrl":"your blog url",  
    *"blogNewPostUrl":"your new post need to ping",  
    *"blogRSS":"your rss url",  
    *"username":"",  
    *"password":"",  

get your evernote authtoken & notesStoreUrl(https://www.evernote.com/api/DeveloperToken.action)

"existedBlog" config you do not want to synced notes' title. If you add notes' title to this file, those notes can not be published to blog.   

"pingcfg" config your ping service after publish new blog.
